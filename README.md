This repository demonstrates a common C++ error involving undefined behavior when using raw pointers with std::vector.  The `bug.cpp` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version using iterators or avoiding raw pointers altogether.  This example highlights the importance of understanding how std::vector's memory management can lead to issues when not handled correctly.  Always prioritize using iterators or safer methods to access and manipulate vector elements to avoid potential crashes or unexpected behavior.
